This program is meant to check whether the input is a binary search tree. I represented my trees by using a vector. I pushed back the int's from standard input into the vector until no more lines could be read. After a line was read to fill a vector, I passed that vector along into a function called checkTree. This function returned a bool value which determines whether the tree was a bst or not. In order to check this I used a for loop to check every position iwithin the vetor. I then used the logic that 2*root + 1 equals the left child while 2*root + 2 equals the right child. THis logic was used to see if the left child was greater than the root (if it was return false). It was also used to see if the root was greater than or equal to the right child (if it was then return false). Since every position on the vector was checked, if statements were used to appropriately deal with the positions in the tree that contained -1. If the checkTree function made it through the initial while loop without returning false, then the tree must be a bst, so it returns true. This bool value along with an int calle treeCount (so the sepcfic tree numvber was recorded in the output) was passed to a function called output. This function essentially just outputted that the speciifc tree was a BST if the bool value was true. Otherwise, it outputted that the speciifc tree was not a BST.
